//! Issue #961: a Space's advertised children, with the account's membership.
//!
//! The room list only carries joined rooms, so a Space's own room list could
//! never show what else the Space contains. The server answers that with
//! `/hierarchy`, which the SDK already wraps as the Element X-compatible
//! [`SpaceRoomList`]; this module drives it to completion once and projects the
//! result into Koushi's own vocabulary.
//!
//! A child the Space advertises may be absent from `/hierarchy` when it is an
//! invite-only room. If the sync client already knows that room (for example
//! because an invitation was received), use its local state to project the
//! name and membership. Only completely unknown rooms remain opaque.
