# Safe npm dependency pinning

## Goal

Eliminate every npm vulnerability currently known to `npm audit` from the reproducible Koushi desktop dependency graph before producing a DMG.

## Scope

- Update only `apps/desktop/package.json` and `apps/desktop/package-lock.json` as required to constrain vulnerable transitive packages to fixed versions.
- Keep the existing direct application and developer-tool dependencies unless a parent update is required to obtain a compatible fixed transitive dependency.
- Do not change the user's global Node.js or npm installation.

## Fixed-version policy

The dependency graph must not resolve versions in the advisory ranges reported on 2026-08-05. The initial fixed versions are:

- `brace-expansion`: `2.1.4` for the 2.x line and `5.0.9` for the 5.x line;
- `ip-address`: `10.4.0`;
- `postcss`: `8.5.25`;
- `undici`: `6.28.0` for the 6.x line and `7.29.0` for the 7.x line.

Use npm overrides only where necessary to make the security floor explicit. Preserve incompatible major lines rather than forcing every consumer onto one major version.

## Verification

1. Preserve the existing failing audit result as the red condition: four high-severity vulnerable packages.
2. Regenerate the lockfile using npm's compatible security fix resolution.
3. Delete and recreate local dependencies with `npm ci` so verification does not rely on an incrementally mutated `node_modules`.
4. Require `npm audit --json` to report zero known vulnerabilities across production and development dependencies.
5. Require `npm audit --omit=dev --json` to report zero runtime vulnerabilities.
6. Run TypeScript type checking and build the DMG from the same clean dependency graph.

## Security boundary

An audit result of zero means no vulnerability currently present in the npm advisory database matches the locked dependency graph. It is not a permanent guarantee against future disclosures; CI and release builds should rerun the audit against the current advisory database.
